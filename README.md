# Number Guessing Game
For Java Development internship at CodeSoft

This is a simple Java program that implements a number guessing game built on MVC pattern. The game generates a random number within a specified range, prompts the user to guess the number, and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. 

## Features
- Generates a random number between a specified range.
- Limits the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
- Allows the option for multiple rounds.
- Displays the user's score based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## Getting Started
To run the program, make sure you have Java installed on your system. 

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `NumberGameMain.java` file.

## How to Play
1. The program will display a window with a heading "Guess The Number" and a message to enter a number between 1 to 100.
2. Enter your guess in the provided text field.
3. Click the "Submit" button to submit your guess.
4. You will receive feedback on whether your guess is correct, too high, or too low.
5. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
6. After each round, you will be asked if you want to play again.

## Game Rules
- You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- The game will display the remaining attempts after each guess.
- If you guess the correct number, you win the round.
- If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the correct number and end the round.

## Additional Notes
- You can modify the range of numbers and the maximum number of attempts in the `NumberGameMain.java` file by adjusting the parameters passed to the `NumberGameModel` constructor.
